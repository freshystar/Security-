# Security and data encryption

   Information security is a comprehensive approach to safeguaring all types of information assets. Securing data with encryption is of very much importance in many aspects of todayâ€™s system administration. Moreover, when it comes to accessing systems remotely. Encryption is the basic building block of data security.   
   #### Data encrytion converts data from readable plaintext into an unreable encoded format: ciphertext.
   There are two types of data encryption:
   - Symmetric data encryption and
   - Asymmetric data encryption
   ## Symmetric and Asymetric data encryption
   In the old times and even now, many people used symmetric encryption.
   We had a brief view of what this was all about with Carrie Anne. In simpler words, with symmetric encryption, symmetric keys were used: both parties had a shared password. The data were encrypted with that password and then decrypted using the same password. 
 Asymmetric data encryption was a better approach to data security, since it had to do with the notion of `key pairs`.When we talk of key pairs, we are talking of `public` and `private` keys. 
 Whatever I lock with a private key can only be unlocked with a public key and vice-versa.
   ## SSH Keys
   SSH(Security SHell) is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate and share data. SSH provides a secure encrypted connection between two hosts over an insecure network. It does this via `key pairs`. 
   The connection done via SSH can also be used for terminal access, file transfers and tunneling other applications. SSH works in `authenticating` host and `secure` traffic.
   For more security, the public keys makes use of `fingerprints`.A `fingerprint` is a unique identifier for the server's public key, ensuring the client communicates with the intended server and not a malicious impersonator. Every fingerprint has a `randomart` image. This is simply a support to the public key's fingerprint to compare the public keys `visually`.
   Lets's have an example:
   ```sh
   ssh <ip>
   ```
